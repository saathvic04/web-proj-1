    <p>Sensors are fundamental in IoT devices as they collect real-world data. Various types of sensors are used depending on the application, including temperature sensors, humidity sensors, motion sensors, light sensors, and more specialized sensors like gas sensors or proximity sensors. These sensors convert physical quantities into electrical signals that can be processed by the device.</p>
<p1>Microcontrollers and microprocessors serve as the brains of IoT devices. They process data collected by sensors, execute algorithms, and control actuators based on the input received. Microcontrollers are typically used in low-power, embedded systems with specific tasks, while microprocessors provide more computational power for more complex applications.</p1>
<p2>IoT devices need to communicate data to other devices or central servers. Communication modules facilitate this process by supporting various wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, cellular (2G/3G/4G/5G), and satellite communication. The choice of communication protocol depends on factors such as range, data rate, power consumption, and network availability.</p2>
<p3>Actuators are components that convert electrical signals into physical actions. They enable IoT devices to interact with the physical world by controlling mechanisms such as motors, valves, switches, and relays. Actuators are crucial for applications where IoT devices need to perform actions based on data received from sensors.</p3>
<p4>Efficient power management is critical for IoT devices, especially those deployed in remote or battery-operated environments. Power management units include components like batteries, power regulators, converters, and energy harvesting systems (solar, kinetic, thermal) to optimize power consumption and ensure continuous operation.</p4>
